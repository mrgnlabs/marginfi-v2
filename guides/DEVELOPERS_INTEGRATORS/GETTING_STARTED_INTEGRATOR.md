## Important Instructions (click to learn more)

<details>
<summary> <b>marginfi_account_initialize_pda</b> - Create an Account</summary>

- Note: `marginfi_account_initialize` is not recommended for integrators because it uses an
  ephemeral keypair which must sign.
- Ask us for a unique `third_party_id`! Simply open a PR or reach out through support. With this,
you can quickly grab all the Accounts that belong to your program using a fetch with memCmp.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>lending_account_deposit</b> - deposit into any Bank EXCEPT integrator banks (Kamino, etc)</summary>

- Check `bank.config.asset_tag`, ASSET_TAG_DEFAULT (0) or ASSET_TAG_SOL (1) ASSET_TAG_STAKED (2)
  are allowed with this instruction. Others have their own deposit instruction.
- No Risk Engine check, always considered risk-free
- `amount` is in native token, in native decimal, e.g. 1 SOL = 1 \* 10^9
- Set `deposit_up_to_limit` to "true" to ignore your amount input if near the deposit cap and
deposit only what is available. For example, if the deposit cap is 10 SOL, there is 6 SOL in
the bank, and you attempt to deposit 10, `deposit_up_to_limit` = true will deposit 4,
`deposit_up_to_limit` = false will fail and abort.
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>kamino_deposit</b> - deposit into a Kamino Bank</summary>

- Check `bank.config.asset_tag` ASSET_TAG_KAMINO (3) is allowed with this instruction. Others
  have their own deposit instruction.
