## Key Terms and Kinds of Bankruptcy

* User bankrupt - When a user's liabilities exceed their assets, before accounting for weights, they are eligble to be bankrupt. A user is technically bankrupt after all their remaining assets are liquidated, at which point they will have 0 assets and a non-zero amount of liabilities. All bankruptcies are technically triggered when USERS go bankrupt. Some corollaries and notable facts:
    * Any time a bank is bankrupt, at least one lender in that bank is bankrupt.
    * When taking an eligible user into bankruptcy, if a user has several different liabilities, liquidators get to pick which ones will stay on their books, which means they get to pick which banks will absorb the bad debt.
* Bank bankrupt - Banks where at least one user has bad debt in the manner described above are in a light state of bankruptcy. 
* Bank super-bankruptcy - Banks where the amount of bad debt outstanding in the manner described above exceeds the bank's assets are in a state of super-bankruptcy.


## How Does it Happen?

Bankruptcy is rare. It can only occur in one of the following circumstances, (1) liquidators haven't been running properly, e.g. due to congestion, etc, (2) an asset is too illiquid for liquidators to safely clear, (3) an asset's price changes drastically, before liquidators are able to respond. 

## Discharging a Bankruptcy

First, liquidators consume all the remaining assets that the user has. If the user has A dollars in assets and B dollars in liabilities (in equity value, e.g. excluding any weights), we know that B > A. After liquidation is complete, A_new = 0, and B_new = B - A + X, where X is the liquidation premium and insurance.

Next, the group administrator runs `handle_bankruptcy` on the user. For banks where `PERMISSIONLESS_BAD_DEBT_SETTLEMENT_FLAG` is enabled, anyone can do this. This will perform the following logic:

* If bank's insurance fund > liabilities, then the insurance fund is used to repay the user's liability.
* If the bank's insurance fund is not sufficient, the remaining will be covered by taking liquidity out of the bank, reducing the asset share value. This socializes the loss to all remaining depositors.
* If the bank's insurance fund and liquidity are not sufficient (super-bankruptcy), the bank is killed. The asset share value is set to zero, wiping out all holdings for all other depositors. This state is irrecoverable, and the bank is permanently disabled.

## FAQ

### What Happens if it Doesn't Run?

If Bankruptcy isn't executed on a bankrupt user, then remaining depositors can never withdraw the whole balance in the bank. The last few depositors who try to withdraw will find there are not enough funds - proportional to the liabilities held by bankrupt users.

### When Does This Matter?

Bankruptcy is very rare in the main pool. Almost all bankruptcies occur in Arena, where riskier assets tend to have extremely volatile moves.
