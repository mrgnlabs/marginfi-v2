## MIGRATING PROGRAM AUTHORITY

Migrating program authority to a new squads wallet? Read on.

First, make sure the new squads wallet is configured with an appropriate threshold (typically at least 5) and all owners have been added.

If a regular wallet owns the program, navigate to the new squads wallet, go to developers -> programs -> new program, follow the instructions to add the program via CLI.

If the old squads wallet owns the program, navigate to the old squads wallet, go to developers -> programs, click the program to transfer, hit change authority, and use the address of the new squads wallet.
