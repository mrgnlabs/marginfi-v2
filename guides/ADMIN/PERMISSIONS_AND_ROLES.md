# Permissions and Roles Guide

## Glossary

- **MarginfiGroup** - The top-level account that contains all admin role assignments. Every bank
  and user account belongs to a group.
- **Authority** - The owner of a user's `MarginfiAccount`. This is the keypair that can deposit,
  withdraw, borrow, and repay on that account.
- **PDA** - Program Derived Address. Used for vault authorities and other system-controlled
  accounts. These are not human-controlled keys.
- **FeeState** - A global singleton account that stores protocol-level fee configuration and the
  global fee admin.

## Admin Roles

The `MarginfiGroup` account defines eight distinct admin roles. Each role is a single `Pubkey`
that can be set to an address, including a multisig program. `admin` is the fast operational
authority; `bank_admin` is the slow, timelocked authority for changes that can materially affect
user funds. A legacy group has a zero `bank_admin` after its account is resized; slow-authority
operations are unavailable until `admin` bootstraps it once with `marginfi_group_set_bank_admin`.
After that, only `bank_admin` can rotate the role. `bank_admin` itself cannot be set to the zero
pubkey.

### Bank Admin (Slow / Timelocked)

The bank admin is the safety-critical governance authority and should be a timelocked Squads
wallet.

**Can do:**
- Create banks and configure their oracle / fixed price
- Apply governance-class bank configuration, including weights, risk tier, asset tag, oracle age
  or confidence bounds, and `TOKENLESS_REPAYMENTS_ALLOWED`
- Transition a bank from Paused or ReduceOnly to Operational
- Set the `emode_admin`, `risk_admin`, and group-wide e-mode leverage limits
- Perform any e-mode or premium configuration (alongside the dedicated `emode_admin`)
- Initialize, edit, and transition staked-collateral settings
- Operate a frozen user account for remediation or seizure

**Cannot do:**
- Fast emergency actions such as freezing a user account, pausing/reducing a bank, or changing
  circuit-breaker settings, unless it also holds the fast `admin` role

### Admin (Group Admin)

The fast operational authority. This role is intentionally able to stop or constrain activity
quickly, but it cannot make the risk-sensitive changes listed under `bank_admin`.

**Can do:**
- Configure fast-admin bank settings: capacity limits, interest curves, settings freeze, and
  circuit breakers
- Transition a bank to Paused or ReduceOnly
- Set fast operational roles (`admin`, curve, limit, flow, emissions, and metadata delegates)
- Freeze and unfreeze individual user accounts
- Handle bankruptcy (in addition to `risk_admin`)
- Close banks (when `CLOSE_ENABLED` flag is set)
- Collect and withdraw group fees

**Cannot do:**
- Set a bank to `KilledByBankruptcy` (only happens programmatically)
- Change global fee state (that's the `global_fee_admin`)
- Set `risk_admin` or `emode_admin`, change e-mode settings, enable tokenless repayments, or edit
  staked settings

### Risk Admin

Responsible for risk management operations.

**Can do:**
- Handle bankruptcy / settle bad debt (for banks without `PERMISSIONLESS_BAD_DEBT_SETTLEMENT`)
- Start forced deleverage (`StartLiquidation` with deleverage mode)
- Force tokenless repayment completion

The risk admin is the day-to-day risk operations role, handling bad debt and liquidation scenarios
that require manual intervention.

### Emode Admin

Controls E-mode (Efficiency Mode) configuration.

**Can do:**
- Set emode tags on banks
- Configure emode entries (preferential collateral ratios for correlated asset pairs)
- Configure same-asset e-mode eligibility and premium settings

The slow `bank_admin` is also authorized for every e-mode and premium configuration instruction.

For more details see the [Emode Guide](../RISK_AND_LIQUIDATORS/EMODE_ADMIN.md).

### Delegate Curve Admin

A scoped admin that can modify interest rate configuration, including both curve parameters and
fee parameters within the interest rate config.

**Can do:**
- Modify curve parameters (`zero_util_rate`, `hundred_util_rate`, `points`) on any bank
- Modify interest rate fee parameters (`insurance_ir_fee`, `insurance_fee_fixed_apr`,
  `protocol_ir_fee`, `protocol_fixed_fee_apr`, `protocol_origination_fee`)
- All via `ConfigureBankLiteCurve` (which takes `InterestRateConfigOpt`)

Note: any update through this path forces the bank to the seven-point curve type. Changes are
blocked if the bank has `FREEZE_SETTINGS` enabled.

This role allows interest rate management to be delegated to a separate party (e.g. a rate
committee) without giving them access to weights, oracle config, or other bank settings.

### Delegate Limit Admin

A scoped admin that can only modify capacity limits.

**Can do:**
- Modify `deposit_limit`, `borrow_limit`, and `total_asset_value_init_limit` on any bank
  (via `ConfigureBankLiteLimit`)

Note: if the bank has `FREEZE_SETTINGS` enabled, only `deposit_limit` and `borrow_limit` can be
changed. The `total_asset_value_init_limit` is treated as a frozen field because reducing it can
affect the value of existing deposited assets.

This is useful for dynamically managing bank capacity, for example adjusting limits based on
demand, without exposing other configuration.

### Delegate Emissions Admin

A deprecated scoped admin role retained for backward compatibility.

**Can do:**
- Nothing on-chain today. This role is currently a no-op.
- The pubkey can still be set/stored via group configuration for compatibility.

### Metadata Admin

A scoped admin for bank metadata only.

**Can do:**
- Write and update metadata for any bank in the group (via `WriteBankMetadata`)

Metadata is informational only and does not affect the behavior of the protocol. This role allows
a separate party (e.g. a front-end team) to manage display names, descriptions, and similar data.

## Global Fee Admin

The `global_fee_admin` is separate from the group-level admin roles. It is stored on the `FeeState`
account (a global singleton).

**Can do:**
- Edit global fee parameters (program fee rates, origination fee shares, init fees)
- Change the global fee wallet
- Set or clear the dedicated pause delegate admin
- Panic-pause the entire protocol (with rate limiting: max 4 consecutive pauses, max 3 per day,
  each lasting 6 hours)

This role is intended for the protocol operator (e.g. the foundation) and controls protocol-level
economics and emergency pause functionality.

## Pause Delegate Admin

The `pause_delegate_admin` is stored on the global `FeeState` account and can be set or cleared by
the `global_fee_admin`.

**Can do:**
- Panic-pause the entire protocol

**Cannot do:**
- Edit fee parameters
- Change the global fee wallet
- Set or clear other admins
- Manually unpause before the pause auto-expires

## Protocol Panic-Pause

When the `global_fee_admin` or `pause_delegate_admin` invokes `panic_pause`, the protocol enters a
group-wide paused state. The pause auto-expires (see `PanicState::PAUSE_DURATION_SECONDS`) and is
rate-limited (max consecutive pauses per window, max per day) so it cannot be held indefinitely.

### Blocked while paused

All normal user flows are disabled:

- Deposit, Borrow, Withdraw, Repay (both native banks and integration banks — Kamino, Drift,
  Juplend, Solend)
- Order placement / order flows
- Account transfer
- Classic liquidation (`LendingAccountLiquidate`)
- Permissionless bank-fee collection
- Permissionless bad-debt settlement (`HandleBankruptcy` when called by a non-admin, even on banks
  with the `PERMISSIONLESS_BAD_DEBT_SETTLEMENT` flag)
- Bank configuration changes (`LendingPoolConfigureBank` and
  `LendingPoolConfigureBankGov`)

### Permitted while paused (admin exceptions)

A narrow set of actions remain available so the admin/risk_admin can actually resolve the
incident the pause was called for:

- **Forced deleverage** — `risk_admin` can run the full deleverage flow (`StartLiquidation` in
  deleverage mode, plus the withdraw/repay instructions that execute while
  `ACCOUNT_IN_DELEVERAGE` is set). The pause checks on withdraw/repay (including integration
  withdrawals on Kamino, Drift, Juplend, Solend) are bypassed when the account carries this flag,
  so a deleverage can be completed end-to-end.
- **Handle bankruptcy by admin** — `admin` or `risk_admin` can call `HandleBankruptcy` while
  paused. This is needed because a forced deleverage often terminates in a bankruptcy, and
  blocking bankruptcy would leave the bank in a half-resolved state. Non-admin callers (even on
  banks with `PERMISSIONLESS_BAD_DEBT_SETTLEMENT`) remain blocked until the pause expires.
- **Unpause** — `global_fee_admin` can always end the pause early via `panic_unpause`, and anyone
  can permissionlessly clear an expired pause via `panic_unpause_permissionless`.

### Emergency-only instructions (mainnet-disabled)

Two instructions are compiled into the program but guarded to `panic!` if invoked on the mainnet
deployment, following the same pattern as `lending_pool_clone_bank`:

- `super_admin_deposit` — transfers tokens from the admin's account into a bank's liquidity
  vault and raises `asset_share_value`, crediting the gain proportionally to existing depositors.
  Intended for crediting recovered funds back to affected depositors after an incident.
- `super_admin_withdraw` — the inverse: pulls tokens from a bank's liquidity vault (to a
  hard-coded recovery wallet on live networks) and lowers `asset_share_value`. Additionally
  refuses to run if the resulting share value would drop to ≤ `0.8`, as a safety rail.

They live in source, not on a separate branch, so that they keep compiling against current types
in CI and remain ready to enable via a targeted deployment if a future incident genuinely
requires them. On mainnet they are inert. On staging/localnet they are available for reproducing
specific bank states during testing.

See the module-level doc comments on these instructions for the full rationale.

## User-Level Access

### Account Authority

Every `MarginfiAccount` has an `authority` field: the keypair that controls it.

**Can do:**
- Deposit into the account
- Withdraw from the account
- Borrow against the account
- Repay debts on the account
- Perform flash loans
- Transfer the account to a new authority
- Close the account

### Permissionless Operations

Some instructions can be called by anyone:

- **`LendingPoolCollectBankFees`** - Moves accrued fees from the liquidity vault to the appropriate
  fee vaults. Anyone can call this.
- **`LendingPoolWithdrawFeesPermissionless`** - Sends fees to the admin's pre-configured
  destination account, if one has been set.
- **`LendingAccountLiquidate`** (classic liquidation) - Any signer can liquidate an unhealthy
  account.
- **`StartLiquidation`** (receivership liquidation) - Any signer can initiate receivership
  liquidation of an unhealthy account.
- **`HandleBankruptcy`** - Only permissionless if the bank has the
  `PERMISSIONLESS_BAD_DEBT_SETTLEMENT` flag set.
- **Interest accrual** - Happens automatically when any user interacts with a bank.

## Special Account States

### Frozen Accounts

The fast group admin can freeze any individual user account. When frozen:
- The account's authority is blocked from all operations.
- Only the slow `bank_admin` can operate on the account (e.g. to withdraw or rebalance).
- The account remains frozen until explicitly unfrozen by the admin.

This is used for compliance, investigations, or protecting accounts in unusual situations.

### Receivership

When an account enters receivership liquidation:
- The designated `liquidation_receiver` gets temporary authority over the account.
- The original authority is temporarily locked out.
- Operations like withdraw become permissionless during receivership (anyone with
  `allow_receivership=true` authorization can act).

For more details see the [Receivership Liquidation Guide](../RISK_AND_LIQUIDATORS/RECEIVERSHIP_LIQUIDATION.md).
