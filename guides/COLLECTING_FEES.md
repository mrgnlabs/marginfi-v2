# Fee Administrator Guide

Are you an accountant or the person responsible for collecting bank fees? Read on.

## Glossary

- **Insurance fee** - Used to offset socialized losses in the event of bankruptcy. 
- **Group fee** - Goes to the group owner. For the main pool, this is marginfi. For permissionless arena pools, this is whoever created the pool.
- **Program fee** - Goes to the program owner (i.e. margin foundation).
- **Base rate** - The rate determined by the curve parameters and current utilization. A more detailed explanation is beyond the scope of this guide.
- **Ir rate** - A rate that scales off the base rate, for example an ir rate of 10% means you will pay 10% of the base rate. 
- **Fixed rate** - A rate of 10% here would mean users pay exactly 10%
- **Origination Fee** - A % of the borrow amount charged when a borrow is initiated. Typically only applies to arena.
- **Flat sol fee** - A fixed amount of SOL charged when creating a new bank. Typically only applies to arena.
- **Global fee wallet** - One per program, a wallet that receives all program fees. Can be changed
  by the global fee admin.

## Kinds of Fees And How Earned

- **Interest** - When interest accrues, the borrow rate is calculated as 
```
base_rate * (1 + insurance_ir + group_ir + program_ir) + insurance_fixed + group_fixed + program_fixed.
```
For example, if the base rate is 10%, and the group_ir rate is 10%, and the group_fixed rate is 1%,
then the group gets 10% * 10% + 1% = 2% APR. Interest is only paid by borrowers, so banks without
borrowers (like Staked Collateral) never earn fees.
- **Origination fee** - The group admin configures this as a percentage of the borrow, and the
  program admin determine what portion of this fee goes to them. For example, if the origination fee
  is 1%, and the program_ir is 10%, then the group gets 0.9% and the program gets 0.1% of any
  borrow. A user borrowing \$100 would pay \$101, where 90 cents goes to the group and 10 cents to
  the program.
- **Flat sol fee** - Automatically debited to the global program fee wallet any time a bank is created on Arena.

## How Interest Accumulates

When any user interacts with marginfi in a way that changes the balance of a bank,
accrue_interest runs first. Based on the rate and how much time has elapsed, the program adds to the
following bank fields:
```
collected_insurance_fees_outstanding
collected_group_fees_outstanding
collected_program_fees_outstanding
```
This (along with the base rate itself) causes the `asset_share_value` and/or `liability_share_value`
to increase.

## How Fees Are Collected

(1) Interset accrues and increases the number in `fees_outstanding` fields. Optionally, origination
fees are charged and do the same.

(2) Anyone (the ix is permissionless) runs `LendingPoolCollectBankFees`. This moves:
* The amount specified in `collected_insurance_fees_outstanding` from the `liquidity_vault` to the
  `insurance_vault`
* The amount specified in `collected_group_fees_outstanding` from the `liquidity_vault` to the `fee_vault`
* The amount specified in `collected_program_fees_outstanding` from the `liquidity_vault` to the
    `fee_ata`, which is the cannonical ATA of the global fee wallet.

Then the `fees_outstanding` are all reset to zero. The vast majority of the time, we run this ix just before a withdraw.

(3) The group admin runs `LendingPoolWithdrawFees`. This moves:
* The amount in `fee_vault` into any account of the group admin's choosing. 

(3a) If the group admin set a destination of choice with `LendingPoolUpdateFeesDestinationAccount`,
then anyone can run `LendingPoolWithdrawFeesPermissionless`, which does the same thing as
`LendingPoolWithdrawFees` but doesn't require permission, and always sends to the account defined by
the group admin (`bank.fees_destination_account`)
