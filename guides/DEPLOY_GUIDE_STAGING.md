## DEPLOYING TO STAGING

Staging is different from mainnet only in that it uses a different key. Ensure that the key in lib.rs matches the intended staging key (typically stag8sTKds2h4KzjUw3zKTsxbqvT4XKHdaR9X9E6Rct)

### Requirements

* You have access to the staging program authority wallet (we will assume it is at `~/keys/staging-deploy.json` from here on)
* Anchor 0.31.1
* Solana 2.1.20

## Preferred Steps

* Build with `anchor build -p marginfi -- --no-default-features --features staging`
* Run:
```
solana program deploy --use-rpc \
  target/deploy/marginfi.so \
  --program-id stag8sTKds2h4KzjUw3zKTsxbqvT4XKHdaR9X9E6Rct \
  --keypair ~/keys/staging-deploy.json \
  --fee-payer ~/keys/staging-deploy.json \
  --url <your rpc (a paid RPC is likely required here)>
```
If this is your first time deploying, use the keypair.json in the target folder instead of the program's id for program-id 
* Failed? That happens often. `solana program close --buffers -k ~/keys/staging-deploy.json` to recover the buffer funds and try again (Note: this costs you .02 SOL to try again)
* Still failing? That happens. Try to recover the buffer instead of closing it: `solana-keygen recover -o recovered-buffer.json` (then enter the buffer seed phrase). Then:
```
solana program deploy --use-rpc \
  target/deploy/marginfi.so \
  --program-id stag8sTKds2h4KzjUw3zKTsxbqvT4XKHdaR9X9E6Rct \
  --keypair ~/keys/staging-deploy.json \
  --fee-payer ~/keys/staging-deploy.json \
  --url <your rpc (https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com is usually fine)> \
  --buffer recovered-buffer.json
```
* Program buffer full (e.g. `account data too small for instruction`)? Use:
```
solana program extend \
  --url <RPC_URL> \
  --keypair ~/keys/staging-deploy.json \
  stag8sTKds2h4KzjUw3zKTsxbqvT4XKHdaR9X9E6Rct 10000
```
* If you changed your wallet config, make sure to remove the staging wallet from your Solana config to avoid sausage fingers errors in the future: `solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json`

### Alternative Steps With Anchor

* Note: this rarely works, the program is probably too chonky.
* Build with `anchor build -p marginfi -- --no-default-features --features staging`
* If this is your first time deploying (to a new key), with `anchor build -p marginfi -- --no-default-features --features staging`
* Ensure anchor.toml is configured like this: 
```
[provider]
cluster = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
wallet = "~/keys/staging-deploy.json"
```
Adjust the cluster as needed if using a custom rpc.
* Deploy with `anchor upgrade target/deploy/marginfi.so --program-id stag8sTKds2h4KzjUw3zKTsxbqvT4XKHdaR9X9E6Rct`. Use deploy instead upgrade if this is your first deployment, and use the keypair.json in the target folder instead of the program's id for program-id.


## Deploying the IDL

Check who the authority wallet is with:
```
anchor idl authority \    
  stag8sTKds2h4KzjUw3zKTsxbqvT4XKHdaR9X9E6Rct \
  --provider.cluster <your rpc (https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com is usually fine)> \
  --provider.wallet   ~/keys/staging-deploy.json
```
We'll assume the authority is `~/keys/staging-deploy.json`.

Run:
```
anchor idl init \
  stag8sTKds2h4KzjUw3zKTsxbqvT4XKHdaR9X9E6Rct \
  -f target/idl/marginfi.json \
  --provider.cluster <your rpc (a paid RPC is likely required here)> \
  --provider.wallet   ~/keys/staging-deploy.json
```

## Deploying Staked Collateral to Staging

Note: Generally, don't bother doing this. Just use the actual mainnet deployment of the program at `SVSPxpvHdN29nkVg9rPapPNDddN5DipNLRUFhyjFThE`, maintained by the Solana Foundation. If for some reason you don't want to, read on.

The Staked Collateral feature uses spl-single-pool, developed by the Solana Foundation (https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/single-pool). This guide will show you how to deploy that program.

First you will need: 
* Agave tools 2.1.0 or later (`sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"`) and possibly `agave-install init 2.1.0`
* A wallet with at least 2 SOL (this guide will assume your wallet is at `~/keys/staging-deploy.json`). Verify the pubkey of your wallet with `solana-keygen pubkey ~/keys/staging-deploy.json` and verify you have at least 2 SOL with `solana balance -k ~/keys/staging-deploy.json`
* An RPC provider connected to mainnet (`solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`). The solana public api is usually fine.

Steps:
* Clone https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/single-pool and pull latest
* Navigate to programs/single-pool and run `cargo build-sbf`
* Navigate back up to root, then navigate to target. Verify that `solana-keygen pubkey deploy/spl_single_pool-keypair.json` matches the program's declared id. If you want to generate a new id, delete this file and build again to generate a new program keypair. Don't forget to update the declare_id in lib.rs as needed.
* Deploy the program with:
```
solana program deploy \                                                  
  deploy/spl_single_pool.so \
  --program-id deploy/spl_single_pool-keypair.json \
  --keypair ~/keys/staging-deploy.json \
  --fee-payer ~/keys/staging-deploy.json \
  --url <your_rpc_url (optional, omit this line to use api.mainnet-beta)>
```
