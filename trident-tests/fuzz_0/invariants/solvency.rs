#![allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]

//! Bank-level solvency invariant ported from the legacy libfuzzer harness
//! (`programs/marginfi/fuzz/fuzz_targets/lend.rs::verify_end_state`).
//!
//! For every bank, the SPL token balance held in the liquidity vault, minus
//! the bank's outstanding fee buckets, must equal `total_deposits −
//! total_liabilities` (where each is shares × share-value), within a 1-unit
//! tolerance. This is the on-chain analog of "the cash drawer reconciles
//! with the books" — interest accrual must mint the same value of shares it
//! changes the share-value by, and every deposit/withdraw/borrow/repay must
//! leave the equation unchanged.
//!
//! The libfuzzer original called `bank_data.accrue_interest(...)` directly
//! on the in-memory `Bank`; we instead submit a real
//! `LendingPoolAccrueBankInterest` ix before checking (see the call site in
//! `methods/core.rs::lending_pool_accrue_all_banks`).
